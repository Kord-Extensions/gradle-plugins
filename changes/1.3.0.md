# Gradle Plugins 1.3.0

This version makes some changes to the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

The KordEx plugin is now ready for Kord Extensions 2 and is more resilient to metadata resolution problems.

- Add support for Kord Extensions 2 dependencies.
- When using Kord Extensions 2, warn about v1 module names and rename them to match the v2 names.
  - When using Kord Extensions 1, this will also happen in reverse for v2 module names.
  - **This will become an error in later versions of the plugin.**
- Resolvers can now handle missing repository metadata gracefully and provide a more explicit error when they can't
  resolve a version.
