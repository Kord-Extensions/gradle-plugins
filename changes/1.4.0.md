# Gradle Plugins 1.4.0

This version involves a significant rewrite of the KordEx plugin, and some small changes to the Docker plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

I've rewritten most of the plugin, making it more lazy and moving a lot of code out of `afterEvaluate`.

This, along with the other edits, introduces the following changes:

- The KSP plugin now actually notices the annotation processor dependency and works correctly.
- The bot metadata was out of date when you changed the settings, preventing regeneration. I've now fixed this.
- Fix an oversight that caused an error when you didn't manually configure a data collection level.

## Docker Plugin

This version includes the following changes:

- The plugin will now always regenerate the Dockerfile. This fixes a problem where the Dockerfile would always be out of date when you update your configuration.
