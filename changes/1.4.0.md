# Gradle Plugins 1.4.0

This version involves a significant rewrite of the KordEx plugin, and some small changes to the Docker plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

I've rewritten most of the plugin, making it more lazy and moving a lot of code out of `afterEvaluate`.

This, along with the other edits, introduces the following changes:

- Fix an issue where the Gradle metadata may fail to parse due to unknown keys being present.
- Fix an issue where the bot metadata was out of date when you changed the settings, preventing regeneration.
- Fix an oversight that caused an error when you didn't manually configure a data collection level.

This release doesn't fix the KSP plugin issue â€” we're still working on that!

## Docker Plugin

This version includes the following changes:

- The plugin will now always regenerate the Dockerfile. This fixes a problem where the Dockerfile would always be out of date when you update your configuration.
