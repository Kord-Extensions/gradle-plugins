# Gradle Plugins 1.3.2

This version includes a small change to the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

When you have the KSP plugin applied, the KordEx plugin automatically configures the annotation processor. Now, the plugin will also configure the relevant source-sets, so your IDE will be aware of KSP-generated files.
