# Gradle Plugins 1.2.0

This version adds a new plugin â€” the Docker plugin from the template repo.

## Docker Plugin

This (relatively simple) plugin allows you to generate a Dockerfile based on a Kotlin DSL, centralising your project's configuration and allowing Docker to adapt to changes, such as renaming a Gradle project.

For more information, [see the documentation](https://docs.kordex.dev/docker-plugin.html). It is pretty long!
