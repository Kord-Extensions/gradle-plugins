# Gradle Plugins 1.0.4

This version targets the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

This release includes the following changes:

- Start linting with Detekt, add an editorconfig, and reformat source files.
- Merged PR #3 by @DRSchlaubi - thanks!
  - Update Gradle to 8.9 and Kotlin to 1.98.23.
  - Omit Gradle API/Groovy from the built plugin JAR.
  - Switch to Gradle `Property` objects for plugin configuration.
- Switch to KordEx Maven repo subdomains, which don't execute S3 commands. These domains provide direct access to the R2 buckets storing the Maven artefacts, and you won't be able to browse them directly.

  The domains are:
  - **Releases:** https://releases-repo.kordex.dev
  - **Snapshots:** https://snapshots-repo.kordex.dev
