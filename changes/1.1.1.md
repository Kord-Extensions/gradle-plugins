# Gradle Plugins 1.1.1

This version targets the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

This release includes the following changes:

- Automatically adds the KordEx annotation processor when you apply the KSP plugin to the project.
- Fix a typo that prevented the Fabric repo from being added to your project's repositories when using the `extra-mappings` module.
- Support for optionally supplying custom configurations to apply dependencies to.
- Support for projects that aren't bots or plugins, such as standalone modules. This means you can go back to omitting the `kordEx { }` block, or omit the `bot { }` and `plugin { }` blocks, and the plugin will work as expected.
- Non-bot or -plugin projects will automatically avoid depending on Kord's voice module.
