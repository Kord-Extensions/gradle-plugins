# Gradle Plugins 1.4.1

This version includes some small changes to the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

- Fixed a problem where specifying a specific snapshot (rather than a moving snapshot version) would throw an error.
- The plugin now applies KSP source-sets automatically again.

This version should fix the KSP issues we've noticed recently. Let us know how you get on!
