# Gradle Plugins 1.2.1

This version makes a small change to the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

For developers working on complex Gradle projects, the plugin now supports an `addDependencies` configuration option, which you can use to prevent the plugin from configuring any dependencies.

This may be useful in multi-module projects where you want to define a "common" module that depends on Kord Extensions and configure bots in other modules depending on that one.
