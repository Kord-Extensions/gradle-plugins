# Gradle Plugins 1.1.2

This version targets the KordEx plugin.

## KordEx Plugin

This release includes the following changes:

- Add a `jvmTarget` option to the `kordEx { }` builder, which overrides the JVM compilation target. This would usually come from Kord Extensions, but some projects may need to supply their own version when dealing with some dependencies.
